# Recursive Optimization — Convergence Pass Findings

## Session 29 — Final Status (All Batches Complete)

### CRITICAL-001: PDF Export Renders Black Page
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Added `mask-image: none !important` and comprehensive print overrides in index.css.

### CRITICAL-002: Mobile Bottom Nav Has Too Many Items
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Current state:** More menu has exactly 8 items (Projects, Library, Skills, Schedule, Connectors, Memory, Settings, Help) — aligned with Manus.

### CRITICAL-003: Sidebar Explore Section Has Non-Manus Items
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Current state:** Sidebar has Projects, Library, Skills, Schedule, Connectors, Memory, Billing, Help — all valid items. Discover removed from sidebar (route still exists for direct access).

### HIGH-001: Agent Self-Awareness — Claims It Cannot Deploy/Render
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Added Platform Self-Awareness section to agent system prompt. Agent now knows it IS the platform.

### HIGH-002: GitHub Tool Response Quality — Generic Instead of Specific
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Enhanced github_ops(status) mode to return actual file tree, README, commits, language breakdown. Verified on production.

### HIGH-003: Agent Over-Eagerness — Builds Webapps for Simple Questions
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Added proportional response rule (11b), Max mode exception for simple questions, and ACTION-FIRST PRINCIPLE exception for informational queries.

### MEDIUM-001: Mobile Sidebar Cramped
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Increased touch targets to py-2.5, mobile drawer already has proper padding.

### MEDIUM-002: Status Indicators Use Plain 'X' Instead of Icons
**Status:** FALSE POSITIVE ✓
**Analysis:** All status indicators already use proper lucide-react icons (AlertCircle, AlertTriangle, CheckCircle2, Loader2). The "X" in the video was likely the lucide X icon used for close buttons, not a status indicator.

### MEDIUM-003: Print Header Missing Task Metadata
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Print header now includes: status, message count, tool calls, estimated cost, and model mode.

### LOW-001: Color Contrast on Filter Tabs
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Fix:** Changed from text-[10px] bg-primary to text-[11px] bg-[oklch(0.52_0.19_252)] — 5.6:1 ratio.

### LOW-002: Package Badge Strip on Home Page
**Status:** COSMETIC — ACCEPTED
**Note:** "Powered by" badges are intentional branding showing platform capabilities.

### TEST-001: 7 Test Files Failing (60 tests)
**Status:** FIXED ✓
**Root causes:**
1. Missing `validateGitHubToken` mock in githubApi vi.mock() — added to pass37e, pass38
2. Sidebar/mobile nav tests expected removed items (GitHub, Discover) — updated cycle7, pass37b, pass46
3. p20 test expected exact `window.open` signature without `noopener,noreferrer` — relaxed assertion
4. pass36 security test false-positived on the word "token" in error messages — made regex more precise

## Next Pass Required: Convergence Pass 2 (need 3 consecutive clean passes)
- Pass type: Adversarial (probe for hidden failure modes)
- Focus: Agent response quality, edge cases, error recovery
